# ASE366KGroundTrackProject
Ground track tool written for a project in ASE366K Spacecraft Dynamics.
A ground track tool for a two-body orbit around the Earth that uses an ODE solver to advance the orbit in time. The tool takes a single 10-dimensional vector to specify the inputs of semi-major axis in kilometers, inclination in degrees, argument of periapse in degrees, longitude of ascending node in degrees, initial true anomaly in degrees, number of complete spacecraft orbits to propagate, greenwich sidereal angle at initial time in degrees, observer longitude in degrees, and observer latitude in degrees. The tool outputs a ground track of the object on top of a longitude latitude map, the body-fixed trajectory, the inertial trajectory, the azimuth and elevation as a function of time for the observer, an animation of the spacecraft motion along the ground track, and text results reporting the inertial position and velocity vectors expressed in the body-fixed frame, the azimuth and elevation in degrees, and the longitude and latitude in degrees. The code is validated by recreating three examples from class, then is used to generate outputs for three spacecraft revolutions of eight example inputs, then is used to design a circular repeat ground track, then is used to generate a ground track for the ISS to verify the accuracy of the tool.
